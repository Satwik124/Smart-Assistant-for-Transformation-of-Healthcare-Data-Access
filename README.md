# Smart-Assistant-for-Transformation-of-Healthcare-Data-Access
Smart Assistant for Healthcare Data Access is an AI-powered chatbot designed to enhance data accessibility and decision-making within a large hospital system. It provides instant, accurate responses to both objective and subjective queries, streamlining hospital operations, improving patient experiences, and simplifying billing inquiries. The chatbot dynamically generates SQL queries to retrieve structured data while interpreting unstructured text, such as patient reviews, for subjective inquiries.

Leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for efficient data handling and a Neo4j knowledge graph for contextual understanding, it ensures accurate and context-aware responses to diverse questions. Its unique capability to differentiate between question types allows it to select the appropriate data source for tailored responses. Built with LangChain, FastAPI, and Streamlit, this assistant empowers stakeholders to access real-time insights without query language expertise, offering a seamless and efficient user experience.
